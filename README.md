# Phone Forward

Project from individual programming project coursework, during which I got familiar with optimal memory management by implementing complex data structures. The goal of the project was to implement a tool for phone number forwarding management, which allows the user to forward a phone number and get all phone numbers that forward to a given number.

**Technologies:** C, CMake, Doxygen, Valgrind
